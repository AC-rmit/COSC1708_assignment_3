						<h2>Reflection</h2>
						<h3>Group Reflection</h3>
						<p>Compared to our previous assignment, we started off with a higher production rate at the beginning now that we were familiar with each other. With feedback from Anthony regarding our teamwork and assignment 2, implemented a two-person per task system in order to expose ourselves to more opportunities to work together outside of meetings and ensure progress does not halt with individual members were unable to attend or contribute for a time. This worked particularly well when Sahil had a leave of absence due to family reasons, and so Mihir was capable of continuing where Sahil left off and other members could contribute to make up the loss of a member.  </p>
						<p>An ongoing issue from the last assignment may be the hesitation in communicating, even with the new assignment task system. This may be due to other commitments each member of the team had, whether it was personal or academic clashing. This resulted in some progress of researching and developing artefacts to be somewhat delayed, though not as grievously as last the assignment, as the report and HTML section has been completed with more time to spare this time around. </p>
						<p>Productivity does seem to increase with regular meeting updates, as these meetings over Microsoft Teams gave us the opportunity to discuss other avenues of research and development. Working in one file that can be updated live is partially useful as members can correct and add to report content in real-time and ask for active feedback in case writing processes come to a halt. Though the most pleasant surprise were some “Eureka” moments when discussing avenues of technology research, as on more than one occasion we made leaps and bounds in progress from one member simply discussing his current knowledge and another member commenting on a resource that they know of that could be instrumental in furthering the assignment goals. Pooling together collective knowledge may be a more productive means to move forward as future assignment progresses, even if it is just a run-off discussion of previous experiences.  </p>
						<p>Regards to skills and experiences already brought to the table and developed during this assignment. Adam’s Figma experience brought the visual component of our app to life, Aby’s dedication to improving database integration with API made leaps and bounds, Sahil and Mihir brought the structure of our report to fruition, with Mihir carefully bringing Sahil’s portion up to speed. Xiaolong’s coding experience gave more weight to our plans and progress for his research into Google Maps and how it can be used for our app. Lastly, Aaron’s previous experience in database management got the usage of SQL and databases for the app off the ground.  </p>
						<h3>Individual Reflection</h3>
						<h3>Aaron</h3>
						<p>This time around I believe our ability to cooperate has improved since our second assignment, as even after a few of our members were unable to attend sessions for reasons outside of their control we managed to keep on track on developing our IT artefacts and reports at a stable pace. Initiating multiple members in multiple tasks pushed our members to actively seek each other out for help and status updates and, when a member was out of reach, the tasks were at least handled by someone else who was assigned so progress wouldn’t come to a halt.  </p>
						<p>I found it surprising the amount of research could be revealed from a collaborative discussion as opposed to an individual research assignment, as compared to last assignment where little crossover took place. </p>
						<p>I would say the main difficulty of this assignment would be one that also occurred in the previous, lack of confidence in speaking up ideas and constructive criticism. Perhaps to be expected since at most meetings I took up a lead speaking role due to hesitancy from other members. The others have improved in communicating in and out of classes and meetings, however, trying to attend and speak at the consultations and coming up with very good initiatives for the project. Improving confidence in our own lines of thinking can lead to more active teamwork and hopefully we will gain such confidence as our studies go on. </p>
						<h3>Adam</h3>
						<p>From assignment 2 there was an overall improvement in communication from before and the time management that we used for each of our subtopics worked better than it did previously. More people communicated with each other, and this led to more productive work being done and everyone supporting each other so that we could all finish our work. The main issues were still prevalent from assignment 2 in a lesser form being time management and communication. I believe with more planning and more focused targeting the issue of time management that will be able to be improve, and communication may be improved through everyone talking about their different parts more in each group meeting or at least semi frequent updates. I found it surprising that some of the work such as using map in Figma would be so difficult to get working and having it not function the way I envisioned. I’m sure everyone in this group working in the future will be able to gain confidence which can lead to even better teamwork and be able to lay out great plans for working in groups. </p>
						<h3>Mihir</h3>
						<p>The group worked well together, the teamwork standard was high, and everyone did their assigned tasks to ensure a high standard was reached. In this assignment, the group allocated tasks to multiple people. This resulted in the group being more efficient and effective as there were at least two members per task. More people also communicated with each other, as we became more comfortable talking to one another. This led to more productive work as everyone truly worked a team to complete this assignment. Everyone contributed well and there weren’t any conflicts within the group. Although there were a lot of positives, we could still improve on some areas. We could have improved our time management as we left some tasks late and pushed back some of our soft deadlines accordingly. One thing I found surprising is how well we cooperate with one another and how we have never encountered any conflicts or small arguments. Overall, this group did well and I’m happy with the work we have completed as a team. </p>
						<h3>Aby</h3>
						<p>Assignment 3 introduced a unique set of challenges where I first encountered API integrations and implementing database retrieval. These challenges were interesting, and it was incredibly fulfilling to approach code from a project-oriented perspective, rather than blindly memorising syntax. This approach has significantly improved my confidence with JavaScript despite never having used it before and I feel from now on, project-oriented coding will be my primary method of learning as it seems to allow greater understanding of concepts and how specific functions are laid out and work with each other. Continuing from the previous assignment, tasks were more evenly distributed and communication between team members improved noticeably. Aaron stepped into his role as project manager and team meetings felt a lot more well-rounded. During the second last week I was faced with personal issues that drew my attention away from the project and felt guilty over not contributing as much as I could have and not notifying them about the situation sooner however, I am very grateful to the rest of the team for covering for these shortcomings.  </p>
						<p>I feel that this team has learned and improved significantly from the beginning of the semester, and I’m pleased with the work we’ve achieved.  </p>
						<h3>Xiaolong</h3>
						<p>Unlike Assignment 2 which we basically just worked individually, we have more communication and cooperation in Assignment 3, which makes our work much easier than before. In this assignment, it is our first time to develop an app, and this is much more difficult than I thought. Fortunately, we separate each one’s role in this project, which make the whole project simpler. For me, I’m in charge of developing Parker’s Website version. To be honest, this is the most challenging assignment I’ve ever done. I have to learn JavaScript to apply the APIs, I have to deal with all the bugs that occurred during the development. I found that I still don’t have the confidence to speak in front of the class. The good thing is that my team members encouraged me to do so, to get the attendance mark. To summarise, I still have a long way to go to express my thoughts and talk about new ideas. But as a team, I must say, it is amazing. </p>
						<p>During this assignment, what surprises me most is that the efficiency to work together. In the previous group projects I've done, none of the members are as effective as my current teammates. </p>
						<h3>Sahil</h3>
						<p>The group worked well as a team, the teamwork was great, and each member of the group did their allocated tasks to a great standard, down to every detail. The amount of work completed by each member was also vast and great. This time the group allocated tasks to multiple people. There was at least 2 people per task and that made the group more efficient and effective. The time management could have been improved as some tasks were left to the last 2 weeks of the assignment and soft deadlines had to be pushed back in accordance with the time management. One thing that was surprising in this assignment was how well the group worked together to come together to get all the work done and how well we cooperated and function together as a whole. One thing that I learnt from working with my group is how different everyone can be in terms of personality and how well different personality types work together. I also learnt that working in groups of two can dramatically increase productivity and work quality.</p>
