						<h2>Project Description</h2>
						<h3>Topic</h3>
						<p>For the project, we want to develop a smartphone app called Parker, which aims to help people in Australia find parking lot with available parking space when they are driving out. This app would be available both in iOS and Android system. There is only one goal of our project app – find a parking space near a designated address. </p>
						<h3>Motivation – from Xiaolong Guo, Product Owner</h3>
						<p>A few years ago, I have spent time together with my family in a weekend when we first came to Melbourne. It took us 20 minutes circling around the parking lot outside the shopping mall to find a parking space. We eventually realised that the parking lot was full, so we can only drive out and find another parking lot. I believe that many people have meet the same situation as we did. When looking for parking space outside, there are many problems such as: - Time - Distance - Cost - Accessibility We can easily find the causing of the problems above according to the data from Statista. </p>
						<p>There are approximately 20.14 million motor vehicles in Australia as of January 2021, and the population is 26.02 million. Around 77.4% of Australian may choose to drive out during weekends of holiday. An article published in De Gruyter on 10th March 2020, by Jan Lizbetin and Ladislav Bartuska talked about the issue about lacking parking spaces for road freight transport in cities and dealt with the issue of rest area's location for road freight vehicles in the selected area. Static traffic (car parking) is one of the most difficult aspects of urban transportation. Insufficient capacity or inadequate equipment, for example, cause problems in parking places for big freight vehicles in urban locations. Regional designs for the siting of truck parking lots have not been created in the Czech Republic; rest areas are primarily built on motorways. Drivers are compelled to use other routes to find alternate parking places, jeopardising the safety of the cargo being transported. Due to a scarcity of such parking spots, drivers are forced to break the European Agreement Concerning the Work of Crews of Vehicles Engaged in International Road Transport (AETR) or, because of this agreement, park the truck before it can be loaded.</p>
						<h3>Landscape</h3>
						<p>There are a few products out there in the market that consists of using a smartphone to locate the best parking spots in your area. One of the competitors are Parkhound. Parkhound is an app that contains an interactive online map, which helps connect drivers to look for a short-term or long-term parking spot. This app also has features like booking, which allows users to book a parking spot for a day or months at a time, if available. It has other features, such as providing users with detailed information about available car spaces including access, size of vehicle it can accommodate, security and electric vehicle charging capability. Parker has features like Parkhound, including the ability to filter parking lots based on whether there is a charging station for electric cars and any other specific requirements a user may have for their parking spot.  </p>
						<p>Another similar feature is the utilisation of an online map, as Parker allows users to type the destination into the search bar, which results in nearby parking spots showing up on the map. Although both apps have their similarities, it also has its differences. Parkhound has a booking feature, whereas currently there has been no development of a booking feature for Parker and has no plans to currently. Furthermore, Parker allows users to customise the app interface besides some basic reset themes. Another difference between the two products is that when the users open Parker for the first time, there will be a tutorial teaching people how to use the app. Users can review the tutorial anytime they require assistance or need recollection of how to use the app again. Improvements to be made in both functionality and presentation should be implemented to out Parker app using inspiration from Parkhound and other applications with the express purpose of finding parking spaces.  </p>
