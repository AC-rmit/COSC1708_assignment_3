					<p> This website made using Figma is a prototype for the application named parker which when finished would be able to work with the database and the website google maps and be able to function as a car parking booking service and more. During the initial phase of the creation of the application a basic black, white and grey design was produced which showed the plan on where everything was going to be and what all the functions of the website might be.</p>

					<p> This website made using Figma is a prototype for the application named parker which when finished would be able to work with the database and the website google maps and be able to function as a car parking booking service and more. During the initial phase of the creation of the application a basic black, white and grey design was produced which showed the plan on where everything was going to be and what all the functions of the website might be. </p>		
					<span class="image featured"><img src="Parker Prototype v0.1.png" alt="" /></span>
					<p>During the next step we started to add all of the prototype together into a flow so that it can all be linked together to each other. This includes adding a keyboard to all places that would require typing so that it could show how it could work when the prototype would be finished. This changed the fidelity from a low to a much higher one and making it a more complete and a more functional prototype and showed the flow of the prototype and how it would function under a real-world environment.  </p>
					<span class="image featured"><img src="Flow example Prototype.jpg" alt="" /></span>
					<p> After connecting the pages of the prototype together a font and colour scheme was made with research into what competitors use and looking at designs of other apps and what colours they used to stand out and picking blue and yellow as they complement each other well. After that was done, overlays and fix ups for the flow were made so that clicking each button would allow you to be led to a specific page or do a specific thing that it is meant to do. </p>
					<span class="image featured"><img src="With Overlay prototype.jpg" alt="" /></span> <span class="image featured"><img src="Without overlay prototype.jpg" alt="" /></span>
					<p>Through using interactions and overlays I found out that there was limitation on what I could do, such as not being able to stack overlays and have the interactions for things such as keyboard not being able to be clicked and function normally. This led to it not being as higher of a fidelity as I believed it could be and can only really be solved through expanding the application more away from a prototype and into a fully functional application.  </p>
					<span class="image featured"><img src="Interactions prototype example.jpg" alt="" /></span>
					<p>The final part was the map which was hard to integrate into the prototype. Although there were many troubles it was able to be done through making the map the background due to it needing to overflow and couldn’t be done easily any other way and having it be a 2000 x 2000 image as any image bigger than those had issues loading. After setting it so that the main things such as search bar, title and the connect to the other pages couldn’t move and making the map scroll, a pinpoint was given so that it can show how the prototype can be used and making it so that it will move with the map and clicking on the pinpoint would bring up an overlay providing information on that area.  </p>
