						<h2>Roles</h2>
						<p>Title list for roles in Team Project:</p>
						<p>Adam - UI Designer, Software Developer</p>
						<p>Xiaolong - Web Developer, Product Owner</p>
						<p>Sahil - Concept Writer, Lead Documenter</p>
						<p>Mihir – Concept Writer, UI Designer</p>
						<p>Aby – Developer, Technology Researcher</p>
						<p>Aaron - Data Engineer, Project Lead</p>
						<p>As of Week 11, the roles for each group member are stated in the list above. The roles were created from Week 10 and are allocated justifiably.  </p>
						<p>The first person on the list is Adam who has been allocated the role being the groups UI Designer and Software Developer. The UI Designer role is a role where the allocated member is in charge of researching possible designs for the prototype and designing the prototype itself. The Software Developer role is a role where the allocated member is in charge of using the designs made by the UI Designer and implementing them as part of creating the prototype and making it functional. Adam is a perfect fit for both roles as first, the roles work simultaneously so having one person for both these roles minimises confusion and possible errors. Another reason why Adam is a perfect fit is that he has the most experience with designing and creating a prototype due to his experience with other assignments where he had to achieve the same exact objective as this assignment. </p>
						<p>The second person on the list is Xiaolong who has been allocated the roles of being the Product Owner and being the Web Developer. Since Xiaolong created the project idea, he is therefore allocated to be the supposed owner of the project including the prototypes. The Web Designer role is a role where the allocated member is in charge of creating the GitHub and the website as well as being the lead editor of the websites HTML code. Xiaolong is a perfect fit to be the web developer since he has the most experience with HTML and is quite effective and efficient when it comes to editing HTML code. </p>
						<p>The third person on the list is Sahil who has been allocated the roles of Concept Writer and Lead Documenter. The Concept Writer role is a role where the allocated member is in charge of writing and transcribing the project idea as well as parts of the assignment report. The Lead Documenter is a role where the allocated member is in charge of documenting the thoughts of the group, documenting the project information and be in charge of developing the assignment report as well as to take charge of completing and reviewing the written parts of the report. Sahil is perfect fit to be a concept writer as he has demonstrated outstanding English writing skills. He is also a great fit to be a lead documenter as he has constantly displayed leadership skills when it comes to organising work and structure. </p>
						<p>The fourth person on the list is Mihir who has been allocated the roles of Concept Writer and UI Designer. The Concept Writer role is a role where the allocated member is in charge of writing and transcribing the project idea as well as parts of the assignment report. The UI Designer role is a role where the allocated member is in charge of researching possible designs for the prototype and designing the prototype itself. Since Mihir also has experience with designing prototypes from other university assignments he is a perfect fit for the UI Designer role and Mihir has also demonstrated he is more than capable of documenting the groups ideas and structuring them. </p>
						<p>The fifth person on the list is Aby who has been allocated the role of developer and technology researcher. Software developers are required to understand user requirements, design frameworks, and implement them into software programs. Aby’s puzzle solving mindset is key to his role in ensuring code is written as efficiently as possible to minimise errors and maximise program performance. As technology researcher Aby is also required to identify competitors, study trends within the field and determine how emerging technologies might be implemented to improve our product. Aby’s background in biological research allowed him to efficiently source relevant information from articles and government databases for implementation by our data engineer and web developer.  </p>
						<p>The final person on the list is Aaron who has been allocated the roles of Data Engineer and the Project Lead. The Data Engineer role is a role where the allocated member is in charge of researching and creating the database for the prototype. The Project Lead role is a role where the allocated member is in charge of taking a leadership role within the group and facilitating the ongoings of the project as well as the groups progress. Aaron is a perfect fit for Project Lead role as he handles himself well under pressure, constantly projects his voice and has the most experience with leadership through his job. He is also a perfect fit for the Data Engineer role as that is his future career pathway and he is the most ambitious and experienced when it comes to using databases.  </p>
