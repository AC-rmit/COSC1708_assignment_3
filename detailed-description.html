						<h2>Detailed Description</h2>
						<p>At the beginning of this assignment, we were determined to be able to present a prototype app for iOS that would be able to input a street address and be able to display the locations of nearby carparks and/or street spaces and present information on availability and charge rates. Importantly, we did not expect to have the app to guide a user to the designated carpark or display live information in the time we had to develop it, only that the app itself could display carparking information in a static environment. From that single goal, we split the task into three separate IT technologies, or artefacts, to try and develop this prototype with targets for the end of the assignment period in mind.  </p>
						<p>First would be the design of the overall application in iOS, developing a user interface for project, using an online design tool such as Figma or Proto.io. The aim was to have an app development life cycle from the login/sign up page to the display of a destination on a map of Melbourne (just to start) by the end. </p>
						<p>Second would be design of a database that would hold information on both users of the application and carparks to be displayed, using SQL or an equivalent language. This goal would be comprised of three parts to be completed by the end of the assignment period; designing the logical model where all tables in the database could be conceived, finding any information that is preferably relevant to Melbourneâ€™s parking data for input from official channels such as the city council, and lastly, coding a system that could extract or input information in accordance with the logical model made prior.  </p>
						<p>The third main component would be integration of a mapping system that would display the location of parking on the previously mentioned application map. We decided delving into Google Maps platforms to make use of its accessibility to third party platforms. The hope was that in the time we had we would have a working web application that could input an address and display locations on a map using Google maps on a third-party website or app. </p>
						<p>Integration of all three components above would have been ideal, but realistically we acknowledged it as an unlikely development in the time we had.  </p>
